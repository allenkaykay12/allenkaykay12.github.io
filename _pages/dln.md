## Digital Literacy Narrative Fall 2023

Title: Navigating the Digital Wilderness: My Journey into Digital Humanities

 As a 20-year-old university student, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. When I signed up for this class, I was desperate because I wanted a substitute for another class I was taking. I looked at the syllabus for Introduction to Digital Humanities, and it looked interesting, so that is how I decided to give it a try. I didn't know what to expect, but now, looking back and seeing how much I have learned in the span of 11 weeks, it has been a rewarding experience. Through the assignments done in this class, I have learned how to analyze and interpret large datasets and use data visualization techniques to study relationships. From this, I have gained a deeper understanding of how technology can enhance the way we understand the world around us. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead.

 The design of the class doesn't create a gap between makers and creators, as discussed in the reading "Why I Am Not a Maker," and to me, this was a different way to look at things when compared to my other programming classes. In this article, Debbie Charchra discusses that in the realm of technology, makers are often praised for their ability to create and build, while those who are not actively making are often not given the same recognition. However, this class challenges that notion by emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and problem-solving skills rather than just the act of physically creating something. This supports the author's perspective that "creators understand the process," as it offers a balance for us students to make while also creating meaningful and innovative solutions. 


 Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the basics. I knew how to use social media platforms, common software applications such as word processors and spreadsheets but I had limited knowledge of data analysis and visualization tools. This course introduced me a wide range of digital literacy skills and tools that have expanded my understanding and capabilities in the digital world. I learned how to use tools such as voyant tools for text analysis and this is something that I wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise. The fact that the class used R-programming language has been helpful for a research that I am doing on campus because the class helped understand how R works thus it is easier to read and understand codes and analyze data using R.

In my daily life, I used Google Drive for document storage and Google Calendar for scheduling, but I never truly explored the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. I didn't know that Geocoding is a powerful tool that can be used to convert addresses into geographic coordinates, which can be useful for mapping and spatial analysis. This was one of my many "wow" moments during this class. Every session was an opportunity to discover something new. Introduction to Digital Humanities is one of those classes where you have fun but also learn valuable skills that can be applied in various fields.

In addition to all the skills learnt from the class, I loved the flexibility that came with the asssignments. I was able to choose topics and projects that aligned with my personal interests and goals, allowing me to explore areas of digital humanities that I was truly passionate about. This freedom not only made the assignments more enjoyable, but also enhanced my learning experience as I was able to delve deeper into subjects that resonated with me. Furthermore, the class helped me improve my research skills because, to be able to interpret the results of a given study, I had to do extensive research so as to understand the context and background of the topic. Context is something that is very important, especially in fields where understanding the past is crucial for understanding the present. This not only broadened my knowledge but also improved my critical thinking abilities. By working on such projects, the intersection between science and the humanities became clearer to me, as I realized the importance of combining both disciplines to gain a comprehensive understanding. As Gareth Loudon wrote in his article, "Creativity can be the bridge between science and humanities education," creativity needs both fields at its core to thrive. Science provides the empirical foundation and analytical tools, while the humanities bring in the human context, values, and interpretations. By embracing both disciplines, we can foster a holistic approach that not only deepens our understanding of the world but also enables us to tackle complex challenges with innovative solutions. He refers to Professor Yong Zhao, who believes that "students should learn the subject by being creators rather than passive consumers." This is what Introduction to Digital Humanities has given me an opportunity to do. Not just consume the knowledge but rather actively engage with it and contribute to the understanding of the world through digital tools and technologies. Markdown language became my go-to for formatting text, and platforms like GitHub allowed me to learn from other developers. 

My current abilities have grown significantly, but I am keenly aware of how much more there is to learn. The course has ignited a passion for digital humanities, pushing me to seek further knowledge independently. I now understand that digital literacy is not a static skill but a constantly evolving journey. I aspire to become proficient in data analysis, mastering statistical techniques and data visualization tools to unlock the potential of big data in humanities research. I plan to keep working on small projects by myself by using different tools that were introduced in this class, such as Orange Data Mining, because it is very fun to use and has a lot of resources on how to use it online.


Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

In conclusion, I am excited to combine my passion for technology with the interest in humanities to drive innovation and create meaningful solutions in the digital space. By embracing the digital humanities, we can unlock new possibilities for interdisciplinary collaboration so as to gain a deeper understanding of human culture and history.
