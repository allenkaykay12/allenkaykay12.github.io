## Digital Literacy Narrative Fall 2023

Title: Navigating the Digital Wilderness: My Journey into Digital Humanities

 As a 20-year-old university student, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. When I signed up for this class, I was desperate because I wanted a substitute for another class I was taking. I looked at the syllabus for Introduction to Digital Humanities, and it looked interesting, so that is how I decided to give it a try. I didn't know what to expect, but now, looking back and seeing how much I have learned in the span of 11 weeks, it has been a rewarding experience. Through the assignments done in this class, I have learned how to analyze and interpret large datasets and use data visualization techniques to study relationships. From this, I have gained a deeper understanding of how technology can enhance the way we understand the world around us. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead.

 The design of the class doesn't create a gap between makers and creators, as discussed in the reading "Why I Am Not a Maker," and to me, this was a different way to look at things when compared to my other programming classes. In this article, Debbie Charchra discusses that in the realm of technology, makers are often praised for their ability to create and build, while those who are not actively making are often not given the same recognition. However, this class challenges that notion by emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and problem-solving skills rather than just the act of physically creating something. This supports the author's perspective that "creators understand the process," as it offers a balance for us students to make while also creating meaningful and innovative solutions. 


 Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the basics. I knew how to use social media platforms, common software applications such as word processors and spreadsheets but I had limited knowledge of data analysis and visualization tools. This course introduced me a wide range of digital literacy skills and tools that have expanded my understanding and capabilities in the digital world. I learned how to use tools such as voyant tools for text analysis and this is something that I wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise. The fact that the class used R-programming language has been helpful for a research that I am doing on campus because the class helped understand how R works thus it is easier to read and understand codes and analyze data using R.

In my daily life, I used Google Drive for document storage and Google Calendar for scheduling, but I never truly explored the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. I didn't know that Geocoding is a powerful tool that can be used to convert addresses into geographic coordinates, which can be useful for mapping and spatial analysis. This was one of my many "wow" moments during this class. Every session was an opportunity to discover something new. Introduction to Digital Humanities is one of those classes where you have fun but also learn valuable skills that can be applied in various fields.

In addition to all the skills learnt from the class, I loved the flexibility that came with the asssignments. I was able to choose topics and projects that aligned with my personal interests and goals, allowing me to explore areas of digital humanities that I was truly passionate about. This freedom not only made the assignments more enjoyable, but also enhanced my learning experience as I was able to delve deeper into subjects that resonated with me. Markdown language became my go-to for formatting text, and platforms like GitHub allowed me to learn from other developers. 


Social interaction, too, took on a new dimension as I explored platforms like Slack, Discord, and Reddit, which facilitated discussions and collaboration in ways I had never experienced before. I began to see how online communities formed around shared interests, and I realized the potential for networking and learning from experts in various fields.

However, the true eye-opener was when we delved into research data management and analysis. Tools like Zotero and Mendeley revolutionized the way I organize and cite my sources, making research more efficient and organized. We explored data manipulation with Python and data visualization with tools like Tableau, illuminating the power of data-driven insights.

My current abilities have grown significantly, but I am keenly aware of how much more there is to learn. The course has ignited a passion for digital humanities, pushing me to seek further knowledge independently. I now understand that digital literacy is not a static skill but a constantly evolving journey. I aspire to become proficient in data analysis, mastering statistical techniques and data visualization tools to unlock the potential of big data in humanities research.

Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

In conclusion, I am excited to combine my passion for technology with the interest in humanities to drive innovation and create meaningful solutions in the digital space. By embracing the digital humanities, we can unlock new possibilities for interdisciplinary collaboration so as to gain a deeper understanding of human culture and history.
