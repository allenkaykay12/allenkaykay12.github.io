## Digital Literacy Narrative Fall 2023

Title: Navigating the Digital Wilderness: My Journey into Digital Humanities

 As a 20-year-old university student, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. When I signed up for this class, I was desperate because I wanted a substitute for another class I was taking. I looked at the syllabus for Introduction to Digital Humanities, and it looked interesting, so that is how I decided to give it a try. I didn't know what to expect, but now, looking back and seeing how much I have learned in the span of 11 weeks, it has been a rewarding experience. Through the assignments done in this class, I have learned how to analyze and interpret large datasets and use data visualization techniques to study relationships. From this, I have gained a deeper understanding of how technology can enhance the way we understand the world around us. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead.

 Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the basics. I knew how to use social media platforms, common software applications such as word processors and spreadsheets but I had limited knowledge of data analysis and visualization tools. My content creation process revolved around the simple tools available on my smartphone, and I hardly ventured beyond that comfort zone. Socially, I interacted with friends and classmates on Instagram, but I never delved into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication.

In my daily life, I used Google Drive for document storage and Google Calendar for scheduling, but I never truly explored the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. Frankly, I was swimming in the shallow end of the digital pool, unaware of the vast ocean of possibilities that awaited.

Enrolling in the Digital Humanities course was a pivotal moment. The course exposed me to a plethora of digital tools and concepts that have broadened my horizons. I learned about content management systems like WordPress, which opened up new avenues for blogging and website creation. Markdown language became my go-to for formatting text, and platforms like GitHub allowed me to collaborate with others on coding projects.

Social interaction, too, took on a new dimension as I explored platforms like Slack, Discord, and Reddit, which facilitated discussions and collaboration in ways I had never experienced before. I began to see how online communities formed around shared interests, and I realized the potential for networking and learning from experts in various fields.

However, the true eye-opener was when we delved into research data management and analysis. Tools like Zotero and Mendeley revolutionized the way I organize and cite my sources, making research more efficient and organized. We explored data manipulation with Python and data visualization with tools like Tableau, illuminating the power of data-driven insights.

My current abilities have grown significantly, but I am keenly aware of how much more there is to learn. The course has ignited a passion for digital humanities, pushing me to seek further knowledge independently. I now understand that digital literacy is not a static skill but a constantly evolving journey. I aspire to become proficient in data analysis, mastering statistical techniques and data visualization tools to unlock the potential of big data in humanities research.

Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

In conclusion, I am excited to combine my passion for technology with the interest in humanities to drive innovation and create meaningful solutions in the digital space. By embracing the digital humanities, we can unlock new possibilities for interdisciplinary collaboration so as to gain a deeper understanding of human culture and history.
