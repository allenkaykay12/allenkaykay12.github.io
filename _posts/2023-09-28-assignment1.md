## Assignment 1 Fall 2023

## **Interesting Objects at HAM's Collection**
The Harvard Art Museum [website](https://shorturl.at/amEO5) has an extensive collection of artwork from various time periods and cultures. On its website, there is a wide range of artwork to explore, including paintings, sculptures, photographs, and textiles. Below are some of the interesting pieces that I found particularly captivating. One of the pieces I liked was *Love and Death.* It can be found [here](https://shorturl.at/nsMOV). Love attempting to protect death served as the inspiration for this painting. The painting shows a woman caring for her sick lover, symbolizing the powerful bond between love and mortality. This was interesting to reflect on because it highlights the complex emotions that can arise when love and death intersect. 

In addition, *The Head of Christ Crowned with Thorns* [link](https://shorturl.at/pqLPW) was another piece that caught my attention. As a Christian, this is a painting that holds significant religious meaning for me. *The Head of Christ Crowned with Thorns* portrays the suffering and sacrifice of Jesus, which was a reminder of the immense love and devotion he had for humanity. "Strike with Fist" [check](https://shorturl.at/chpr0) was also a captivating artwork that stood out to me. It is dated 1969, but it is fascinating to see that it is still used nowadays, such as in the Black Lives Matter Movement, as a symbol of solidarity and resistance. 


In the process of trying to find these objects, the website was much easier to navigate since it had the name of the piece as well as the picture, which made it much easier. This was mainly because I wasn't sure what the exact titles of the artworks were, so having both the name and image helped me quickly identify them. However,  in case one knows the piece that he or she is looking for, the CSV files would be helpful to access detailed information about each artwork. 


## **The Most and Least Viewed Objects at HAM**

> By looking at the most and least viewed art pieces in the Harvard Art Museum, we can try to understand some factors that can influence the popularity and appeal of artworks. 
 

Technology has been a great tool for understanding different cultures through acquiring and analyzing large amounts of data. From the information obtained from the Harvard Art Museum, I chose to focus on the "British" culture. This culture was interesting to me because of its rich history and influence on various aspects of global society. One of the ways to study the British artwork was by studying the total pageviews of different pieces available at the HAM. Most of the artworks that ranked top, tell stories of things that we encounter in our everyday lives.

 Firstly, *The Day of Creation: The First Day* [link](https://shorturl.at/hTWY2) by Burne Jones is one of the six paintings in the series that depicts the creation of the world. It tells the story of the first day of creation as described in the Book of Genesis, which is a significant religious text in Christianity, which might make it a popular choice among viewers. It was also interesting to see that Jones' paintings were among the most-viewed British art pieces at the museum, and they mainly have religious themes. Perhaps one of the reasons his work is popular is the way he skillfully captures the essence of spirituality and connects it to the contemporary world. His ability to convey deep religious themes in a relatable and accessible manner would make his work resonate with a wide range of viewers, regardless of their religious beliefs. He is believed to have had a great influence on the modern art movement.

 Furthermore, *The Blessed Damozel* [link](https://shorturl.at/FKV17) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti is the top-viewed item in the British culture section of the Harvard Art Museum. It is a painting that was inspired by a poem that tells the story of a young woman who died at a young age, leaving her loved one behind. This poem explores themes of love, loss, and longing, resonating with audiences across generations. This painting contradicts the Christian vision of heaven since it shows a woman in heaven but with an expression on her face, suggesting that even in paradise, she still carries the weight of her earthly emotions, like the loss of a loved one. The artist skillfully captures the complexity of human emotions and challenges the traditional notions of eternal bliss in the afterlife. Both Burne Jones and Gabriel Rossetti's artworks explore themes that are familiar to our modern understanding of human emotions and experiences. Therefore, this would be one of the reasons why their works continue to resonate with audiences today. 

 On the other hand, there are many other pieces of British culture with no views at all. Most of the least-viewed are those whose artists are not identified. The fact that the artist is not known often results in a lack of historical context and personal narratives that engage viewers. Without knowing the artist's background or intentions, it becomes harder to understand the meaning and significance behind the artwork. In addition to that, the absence of artist identification may contribute to a lack of recognition and appreciation for these pieces. Moreover, unlike the artwork discussed above, the least-viewed pieces do not have themes that are easily relatable or recognizable to the general public. This further hinders their ability to capture the attention and interest of viewers, as they may struggle to connect with or interpret the artwork. 

**Warning Notice:** Some of the ideas mentioned above are mainly my own interpretation of the data from HAM and some are based on assumptions so our opions might vary depending on your own understanding.

## **Comparing Cultures**

The three cultures that I will be comparing are the **British**, **Spanish**, and **Byzantine** cultures. By looking at the accession year of the art works from these cultures to the Harvard Art Museum, I will try to analyze what could have influenced the accession of the art pieces and how they reflect the unique characteristics of each culture. 

<img src="/assets/images/histogram.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

From the histogram above, it is clear that there are more artworks from British culture compared to the Spanish and Byzantine cultures in the Harvard Art Museum. This suggests the presence of more British artwork in the Harvard Art Museum's collection. It was interesting to notice that there are more works of art from the Byzantine culture compared to the Spanish culture. The Byzantine Empire was what is now known as modern-day Turkey and Greece, and its rich artistic tradition has had a significant impact on the development of European art. This empire existed until 1453, but it is rather interesting to see that its artistic legacy still holds a prominent place in the Harvard Art Museum's collection. 
However, looking at the wordcloud of different cultures that are represented at the museum, British and Byzantine cultures have almost the same level of representation by looking at the size and frequency of their respective words in the word cloud. Perhaps it is the fact that not all the objects are shown on the histogram. On requesting objects from the museum's website, some of the objects are lost, and thus, their representation may not be accurately reflected in the histogram. Therefore, it is important to consider different modes of analysis because, when working with such data, it is crucial to take into account potential limitations and biases that may affect the accuracy of the representation. Looking at the data using different figures is a good way to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the museum's collection.

Another important thing that we could do with the information about these cultures is take a close look at their accession years and what factors could have led to the acquisition of more in some years and not others. By doing so, one would gain insights into the museum's collecting practices and some limitations that may hinder the representation of certain cultures in the collection. According to the stacked chart above, we notice a significant reduction in the acquisition of art from three cultures in recent years. However, there has been a consistent acquisition of artwork from Britain, even though in small numbers. This could be that either the museum has a stronger focus on collecting British art or that there is a greater availability of British artwork in the market. There is a peak in 1943, where 1244 art pieces of the total pieces acquired that year were from Britain. One of the reasons for this huge acquisition of British artwork in 1943 could be attributed to the historical context of World War II.  During this time, due to the threat from the Nazi occupation, different European countries sought to protect their artwork by sending it to safer places. Maybe British artists were looking for a place where they could sell their artwork and ensure its preservation during the war. 

<img src="/assets/images/Exhibitiontimeline.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

From the exhibition timeline above, there was a relative increase in the number of exhibitions, which could perhaps be the reason why there was an increase in the acquisition of artwork during this time. Something that I found interesting is the fact that the number of artworks acquired from Spanish culture remained small compared to the other two cultures. Considering that Spanish artwork is popular, one would assume that there would be a higher demand for it during this time. Perhaps it might be the case that Spanish artwork was not as readily available or accessible at that time, leading to a smaller number of acquisitions. There is a huge peak in 1951 for the Byzantine culture; however, from my research, I was not able to identify a specific event that happened around that time that could have led to this huge acquisition of artwork from this culture since it is the only significant peak for the Byzantine culture from the stacked bar graph above. It is possible that it could have been philanthropy from wealthy individuals or institutions that contributed to the sudden increase in acquisitions. However, it is difficult to determine the exact cause without further evidence or historical records.
