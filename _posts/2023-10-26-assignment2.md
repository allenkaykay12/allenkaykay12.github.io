## Assignment 2 Fall 2023: Text Analysis

## *Culture and Emotions
Text analysis is the process of examining and understanding written or spoken language to gain insights and extract meaning from it. It involves using various techniques and tools to analyze the structure, content, and context of a text. For the second assignment, I chose to focus on the relationship between human emotions and culture. By analyzing texts related to human emotions and culture, I aim to look at how culture shapes the way people experience and express their emotions. To study this relationship, I will focus on how culture shapes the way people think and view depression. Examining the role of culture in shaping perspectives on depression can contribute to the development of culturally sensitive interventions for individuals experiencing depression.
