## Assignment 2 Fall 2023: Text Analysis

## *Culture and Emotions*

Text analysis is the process of examining and understanding written or spoken language to gain insights and extract meaning from it. It involves using various techniques and tools to analyze the structure, content, and context of a text. For the second assignment, I chose to focus on the relationship between human emotions and culture. By analyzing texts related to human emotions and culture, I aim to look at how culture shapes the way people experience and express their emotions. To study this relationship, I will focus on how culture shapes the way people think and view depression. Examining the role of culture in shaping perspectives on depression can contribute to the development of culturally sensitive interventions for individuals experiencing depression. 


The texts that I chose for this analysis are "Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness" by William Styron, which represents the Western perspective. "The Art of Happiness" by Dalai and Howard Cutler, which represents the Eastern perspective, is another text that I am using. It offers insights into how Eastern cultures approach and understand mental health. The third text that I chose offers an African perspective on depression; it is a dissertation titled "African trational healers' understanding of depression as a mental illness: implications for social work practices" by Monique Starkowitz. Even though the writer of the dissertation is not African, her research involved interviews with African traditional healers, providing a unique perspective on how depression is understood and treated within African cultures.
