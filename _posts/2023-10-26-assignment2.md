## Assignment 2 Fall 2023: Text Analysis

## *Culture and Emotions*

## *Corpus choice and the motivation for my topic.*

Text analysis is the process of examining and understanding written or spoken language to gain insights and extract meaning from it. It involves using various techniques and tools to analyze the structure, content, and context of a text. For the second assignment, I chose to focus on the relationship between human emotions and culture. By analyzing texts related to human emotions and culture, my aim was to look at how factors such as culture shape the way people experience and express their emotions. To study this relationship, I focused on how depression is perceived and treated in different cultures. My core class touched on the idea of how depression varies from culture to culture and how different cultural beliefs and practices can impact its manifestation and treatment. This sparked my interest in exploring the topic further. I believe that examining the role of culture in shaping perspectives on depression can contribute to the development of culturally sensitive interventions for individuals experiencing depression. 


The texts that I chose for this analysis are "Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness" by William Styron, which represents the Western perspective. "The Art of Happiness" by Dalai and Howard Cutler, which represents the Eastern perspective, is another text that I am using. It offers insights into how Eastern cultures approach and understand mental health. The third text that I chose offers an African perspective on depression; it is a dissertation titled "African trational healers' understanding of depression as a mental illness: implications for social work practices" by Monique Starkowitz. Even though the writer of the dissertation is not African, her research involved interviews with African traditional healers, providing a unique perspective on how depression is understood and treated within African cultures.Choosing the corpus for this assignment was rather challenging because, delving into the realm of emotions and culture, there is a lot to consider, for instance, which emotions would be relevant to study so that they are present in all cultures and which cultures to include in the study. After I decided which emotions and cultures to focus on, I used ChatGPT to search for some of the authors and resources that could be appropriate for my research. I looked at different works from the NYUAD library, Google Scholar, and just normal internet searches. I wanted to also have texts that had themes that were a bit similar so that the analysis could be more comprehensive and comparative.
