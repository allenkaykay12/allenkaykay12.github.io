## Text Analysis: *Culture and Emotions*

## *Corpus choice and the motivation for my topic.*

Text analysis is the process of examining and understanding written or spoken language to gain insights and extract meaning from it. It involves using various techniques and tools to analyze the structure, content, and context of a text. For the second assignment, I chose to focus on the relationship between human emotions and culture. By analyzing texts related to human emotions and culture, my aim was to look at how factors such as culture shape the way people experience and express their emotions. To study this relationship, I focused on how depression is perceived and treated in different cultures. My core class called **"Emotions"** touched on the idea of how depression varies from culture to culture and how different cultural beliefs and practices can impact its treatment. This sparked my interest in exploring the topic further. I believe that examining the role of culture in shaping perspectives on depression can contribute to the development of culturally sensitive interventions for individuals experiencing depression. 


The texts that I chose for this analysis are "Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness" by William Styron, which represents the Western perspective. "The Art of Happiness" by Dalai and Howard Cutler, which represents the Eastern perspective, is another text that I chose for this assignment. It offers insights into how Eastern cultures approach and understand mental health. The third text that I chose offers an African perspective on depression; it is a dissertation titled "African traditional healers' understanding of depression as a mental illness: implications for social work practices" by Monique Starkowitz. Even though the writer of the dissertation is not African, her research involved interviews with African traditional healers, providing a unique perspective on how depression is understood and treated within African culture. Starkowitz's research was conducted among black South Africans. Choosing the corpus for this assignment was rather challenging because, delving into the realm of emotions and culture, there is a lot to consider. For instance, determine which emotions are most relevant for the study, how they are expressed and understood within different cultural contexts, and which cultures to include in the study. After I decided which emotion and cultures to focus on, I used ChatGPT to search for some of the authors and resources that could be appropriate for my research. I looked at different works of different  authors the NYUAD library database, Google Scholar, and just normal internet searches. Another criteria is that I wanted texts that had themes that were a bit similar so that the analysis could be more comprehensive and comparative. 

## *Interpretation: Text Visualization*

Text analysis is one of the tasks in which one has to carry out computational thinking since it involves analyzing and interpreting large amounts of text data using algorithms and then finding the most relevant information from the data. Moving from the corpus to obtaining these insights is more complex than one would imagine. This is where computational thinking comes in handy because it mainly focuses on how computers, maybe applied in the humanities work to automate it. For this assignment, automation and decomposition techniques were at the core since they allowed us to break down the task into smaller, manageable steps. For instance, we get plain text, so we had to parse the text into individual words and sentences. Then, we applied various algorithms to analyze the frequency of words, identify patterns, and extract meaningful information. With this, a task that would be tedious is now made efficient and accurate through the use of computers. This is also referred to as text preprocessing since it involves cleaning and organizing the text data before further analysis. For the text analysis, since we are working with a large corpus most of the time, we can tokenize the text into words or sentences, making the analysis much easier. 

To study the relationship between emotions and cultures, I used voyant tools to create wordclouds that highlighted the most prominent words used in describing emotions in different cultures. This helped me identify common themes and patterns across the three texts, providing a visual representation of the data. For instance, in societies where Buddhism is the leading ideology, depression is barely used; it doesn't even appear on the wordcloud, but rather words such as suffering, happiness, and mind are more prevalent. This suggests that these cultures may have a different understanding and approach to mental well-being, focusing more on mindfulness and acceptance of suffering rather than labeling it as depression. However, by looking at the wordclouds representing the Western and African perspectives, there are words like depression, illness, death, and suicide, which shows that these cultures view depression as an illness that requires attention and treatment. From this example, we can see that culture shapes the way that people perceive different emotions, which is rather fascinating. This made me wonder the extent to which culture influences basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger since they are universal human experiences. What is special about basic emotions that they are recognized across cultures? Is there a biological basis for these emotions that transcends cultural boundaries? How do cultural norms and values influence the expression and interpretation of these universal emotions? This would be really interesting to explore further in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between culture and emotions.

>The Wordclouds are in the order of Western, African and then Eastern(Buddhist) respectively

## *Analyzing the context of the words used.*

Text analysis tools provide us with great functionality for looking at the context in which words are used. This wouldn't be easy to do if we were to do the analysis manually. From the wordcloud, we saw that depression is viewed as an illness in Western and African cultures, but their approaches to treating it differ significantly. In Western cultures, medication and therapy are commonly used, while African cultures often rely on traditional healing practices. For African cultures, specifically the Black South Africans, they would frequently visit the traditional healers before visiting the medical doctor, according to this text. The Easterners, on the other hand, don't view depression as an illness. According to them, suffering is inherently a part of life and should be embraced rather than treated. They believe that experiencing hardships can lead to personal growth and spiritual enlightenment. Therefore, seeking professional help for depression is not as common as in Western and African cultures. For them, engaging in activities such as meditation or seeking guidance from spiritual leaders is considered more effective in dealing with depression.

In addition to that, the word depression appears in all three cultures; however, it is very important to note the differences in how it is understood and perceived by looking at the context in which it is used. In Western cultures, depression is often seen as a medical condition that requires medical intervention and treatment. In Western culture, depression is often described as a mood disorder. From the text, we can also see that Westerners think it is difficult to treat depression, unlike other diseases such as diabetes. This perception may stem from the belief that depression is caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. Although the method of treatment may vary, African cultures also recognize depression as a disease. In African cultures, depression is often viewed as a spiritual affliction, and traditional healers play a significant role in addressing the condition. The perception of depression in Buddhist societies is very different from that in Western cultures. In Buddhist societies, depression is often seen as a result of attachment and craving, and the focus is on achieving mindfulness to overcome it. It is not that people from these cultures are never unhappy, but rather they have different ways of understanding and addressing the condition.

## *Distinctive words from the three cultures*

>*Comparison betweeen Western and African perspectives*

From all the analysis and interpretation of the data, it is clear that culture influences the way that people experience and think about emotions. In this part, I will then focus on identifying the most distinctive words in each culture's language for expressing emotions. In comparing the Western and African cultures, the use of the word depression seems to be common to both cultures. However, it was interesting to note that even though both cultures view depression as an illness, this word is more common in African culture compared to Western culture. This was interesting to me because it challenges the assumption that Western cultures perceive depression as an illness; thus, my assumption was that illness would be more common in Western culture. The word disease is commonly used in Western culture, and perhaps it could be that illness and disease are used interchangeably. Additionally, it could be the fact that the text from Western culture was smaller compared to the one from African culture, leading to a limited representation of the overall perception of depression in Western culture. 

In addition to that, in Western culture, we can see that words such as sleep, anxiety, and failure are commonly associated with depression, which aligns with the medical understanding of the illness. However, in African culture, words like healers, individual and cultural—are associated with depression, highlighting the emphasis on societal and spiritual aspects of healing. This cultural difference in language and perception may provide a more holistic understanding of depression that goes beyond the medical approach present in Western culture. 

>*Comparison betweeen Western and Buddhist perspectives*

Looking at the plot of Western culture against Buddhist culture, it is clear that there are significant differences in the way depression is perceived and treated. In Western culture, depression is often seen as a medical condition that requires medication and therapy, while in Buddhist culture, it is viewed as a result of spiritual imbalance and can be addressed through meditation and mindfulness practices. It is evident that the word depression is more frequently used in western text than in Buddhist perspective text. The western text uses words like illness, disease, and hospital that are commonly associated with depression, emphasizing its medical nature. In contrast, Buddhist text uses terms like suffering, change, accepting when talking about depression, highlighting the spiritual aspect of healing.

>ChatGPT's response using the common words from the Westsern and Buddhist perspectives on depression 

**Prompt to ChatGPT:** *Write a short story to be published in an online newspaper to raise awareness about depression. The words above in order of how often they should appear in our article to be published.*
{: .notice--warning}

I wanted to check how easily ChatGPT would recognize the words from each culture and write a short newspaper story about depression to raise awareness. From the words I used, ChatGPT was able to recognize the difference in cultural perspectives on depression. It seamlessly incorporated medical terminology associated with depression, such as illness and hospital, when discussing the Western perspective. It is very fascinating to see that even AI can understand the diverse ways in which different cultures approach depression.
