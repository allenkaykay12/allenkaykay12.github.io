## Text Analysis: *Culture and Emotions*

## *Corpus choice and the motivation for my topic.*

Text analysis is the process of examining and understanding written or spoken language to gain insights and extract meaning from it. It involves using various techniques and tools to analyze the structure, content, and context of a text. For the second assignment, I chose to focus on the relationship between human emotions and culture. By analyzing texts related to human emotions and culture, my aim was to look at how factors such as culture shape the way people experience and express their emotions. To study this relationship, I focused on how depression is perceived and treated in different cultures. My core class touched on the idea of how depression varies from culture to culture and how different cultural beliefs and practices can impact its manifestation and treatment. This sparked my interest in exploring the topic further. I believe that examining the role of culture in shaping perspectives on depression can contribute to the development of culturally sensitive interventions for individuals experiencing depression. 


The texts that I chose for this analysis are "Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness" by William Styron, which represents the Western perspective. "The Art of Happiness" by Dalai and Howard Cutler, which represents the Eastern perspective, is another text that I am using. It offers insights into how Eastern cultures approach and understand mental health. The third text that I chose offers an African perspective on depression; it is a dissertation titled "African trational healers' understanding of depression as a mental illness: implications for social work practices" by Monique Starkowitz. Even though the writer of the dissertation is not African, her research involved interviews with African traditional healers, providing a unique perspective on how depression is understood and treated within African cultures.Choosing the corpus for this assignment was rather challenging because, delving into the realm of emotions and culture, there is a lot to consider, for instance, which emotions would be relevant to study so that they are present in all cultures and which cultures to include in the study. After I decided which emotions and cultures to focus on, I used ChatGPT to search for some of the authors and resources that could be appropriate for my research. I looked at different works from the NYUAD library, Google Scholar, and just normal internet searches. I wanted to also have texts that had themes that were a bit similar so that the analysis could be more comprehensive and comparative. 

## *Interpretation: Text Visualization*

To study the relationship between emotions and cultures, I used voyant tools to create wordclouds that highlighted the most prominent words used in describing emotions in different cultures. This helped me identify common themes and patterns across various texts, providing a visual representation of the data. For instance, in societies where Buddhism is the leading ideology, depression is barely used; it doesn't even appear on the wordcloud, but rather words such as suffering, happiness, and mind are more prevalent. This suggests that these cultures may have a different understanding and approach to mental well-being, focusing more on mindfulness and acceptance of suffering rather than labeling it as depression. However, by looking at the wordclouds representing the Western and African perspectives, there are words like depression, illness, death, and suicide, which shows that these cultures view depression as an illness that requires attention and treatment. From this example, we can see that culture shapes the way that people perceive different emotions, which is rather fascinating. This made me wonder the extent to which culture influences basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger since they are universal human experiences. What is special about basic emotions that they are recognized across cultures? Is there a biological basis for these emotions that transcends cultural boundaries? How do cultural norms and values influence the expression and interpretation of these universal emotions? This would be really interesting to explore further in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between culture and emotions.

>The Wordclouds are in the order of Western, African and then Eastern(Buddhist) respectively
