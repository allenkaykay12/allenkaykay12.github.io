## Spatial Data: *Brooklyn City and Business Directory*

For the spatial data assignment, I worked with [**The Brookly City Business Directory 1879–80.**](https://shorturl.at/oqCJY)
This directory contains information about businesses in Brooklyn during the years 1879–1880. It includes the names of people, their professions, and street addresses. When I chose this corpus, I wanted to look at the spatial distribution of different types of professions in Brooklyn and analyze how they were clustered in different neighborhoods. By mapping the professions onto the street addresses, I wanted to explore if there were any patterns or concentrations of specific professions in certain areas of Brooklyn. In addition to that, I looked at how the profession was related to gender and whether there were any noticeable disparities in the distribution of professions based on gender. This analysis aimed to provide insights into the occupational landscape in Brooklyn. 

Since there is a lot of information available in the directory, I didn't do manual data extraction. Instead, I used ChatGPT to automate the process of extracting the data. This allowed me to efficiently gather a large amount of information, and this ensured consistency and accuracy in the data extraction process, reducing the chances of human error. To extract the data, I prompted ChatGPT to create a CSV file that contained the names of people, their occupations, and street addresses. ChatGPT was able to classify all the information I gave it, but I needed to do some cleaning up to remove some formatting errors in the CSV file.
