## *Clustering and Classifying Images*

For this part of the assignment, I chose to work with images of flowers. Even though I don't have a lot of knowledge about flowers, I thought it would be very interesting to study and understand how computer algorithms can analyze and classify different types of flowers based on their visual features. Since most of the algorithms are mainly trained to analyze and classify objects such as animals or other objects, working with flowers would provide a unique challenge. This is because flowers have a wide variety of shapes, colors, and different types of patterns, making it more complex for algorithms to accurately classify them. I wondered which of the features the algorithms would prioritize when analyzing and classifying flowers, whether it would be the shape, color, or pattern.
